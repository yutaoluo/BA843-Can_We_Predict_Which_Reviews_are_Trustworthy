# BA843-Can_We_Predict_Which_Reviews_are_Trustworthy
For all reviews for business on Yelp, we will try to ascertain whether they are genuine reviews, or reviews given by trolls/bot accounts. To do this, we will be checking how the sort of ratings the account gives, the number of prior reviews it has given, the traction the account has. We will then be categorizing accounts as ‘trustworthy’ and ‘non-trustworthy’, the implication being that the ‘non trustworthy’ accounts are not reliable and might be trolls or spam accounts. Our next step will be to merge the tables togather, so each row in the review table can be classified as ‘trustworthy’ or ‘non-trustworthy’ on the basis of the user column. Lastly, our ultimate objective will be to create a machine learning model which can utilize features within a review to predict whether it is given by a ‘trustworthy’ account.
